Your task is to design and implement an application that display Pokémon Cards.

user comes to site and enter number of cards and select category of Pokémon.
Hint: take category and no of Pokémon, use API and render.

Resources:
refer this: https://pokeapi.co/
use this https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id} api to get the pokemon data by id.
Note: here id is a number. for example https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1

explain me what do we need to do in this dont give the codes

To design and implement an application that displays Pokémon cards based on the user’s input, here’s a breakdown of the steps you need to follow:

### 1. **User Interaction**

- Create a form or interface where the user can:
    - Input the number of Pokémon cards they want to display.
    - Select a category or type of Pokémon (like fire, water, grass, etc.).

### 2. **Fetch Pokémon Data**

- **API Usage**: Use the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get Pokémon data.
    - The specific endpoint provided is `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}`, where `id` represents the Pokémon's unique ID.
    - Based on the user's input, you need to dynamically generate multiple API calls to retrieve Pokémon data by their IDs.

### 3. **Category Selection**

- Pokémon in the API can be categorized by types (like fire, water, etc.), and you’ll likely need to filter the Pokémon based on the selected category.
- To get the category or type, use the Type API: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/${type_id}`.
    - This will give you a list of all Pokémon of that particular type.
    - From this, randomly select Pokémon IDs to match the number the user requested.

### 4. **Rendering the Cards**

- Once the data is fetched, dynamically create Pokémon "cards" on the webpage.
    - Each card should display relevant information like the Pokémon’s name, image, and any other details like abilities or stats.
- You can use the data returned from the API to populate the cards with the necessary information.

### 5. **Steps Involved**

- **Input Handling**: Handle user input for the number of cards and category/type selection.
- **API Requests**: Based on user input, fetch the Pokémon data using the API.
    - If the user selects a category, fetch the Pokémon list for that category.
    - Use randomization if needed to select specific Pokémon from the category.
- **Rendering**: Once you have the data, dynamically generate and display the Pokémon cards on the UI.
    - Ensure each card has a Pokémon image, name, and some basic stats.

### 6. **Error Handling**

- Ensure that if the user enters an invalid number or there are any API errors, the application handles them gracefully by showing error messages or fallback data.
